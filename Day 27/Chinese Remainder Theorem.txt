Chinese Remainder Theorem -

- It is used to solve system of linear congurences.

  Let's say-
  x%2=1
  
- This can be written in another form like -
    x≡1(mod 2) --> Linear Congurence
    i.e when x%2, it leaves remainder as 1.

  ex- Find a number x, Given :-
      x%2=1, x%3=2, x%7=5

  We'll use CRT to find x.

  Formula for CRT -
  x=(Σ PP[i] * inverse[i] * rem[i])%Product   [i=0 to k-1]

  PP[i]= Product of all numbers except that number.
  PP[i]= (Product of all numbers)/num[i]

  rem[i]= arrayof remainders

  inverse[i]= modular multiplicative inverse of PP[i] with respect to num[i]

  Product= Product of all numbers
