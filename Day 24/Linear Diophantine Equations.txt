Linear Diophantine Equations - 

A diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in 2 or more 
unknowns, such that only the integral solutions are required.

An integral solution is a solution such that all the unknown variables
take only integer values.

Question: 
---------
Given 3 integers a,b,c representing a linear equation of the form
ax+by=c. Determine if the equation has a solution such that x and y
are both integral values.

Solution:
---------
ax+by=c
(a,b,c -> constant, x,y-> variables)

we have to check if integral solution is possible or not.

 Suppose,
  GCD(a,b)=g;
  a=gk1,b=gk2;

  k1g(x) + k2g(y)= c
  k1(x) + k2(y)= c/g

  k1(x) + k2(y) this will be an integer.
  Hence, c/g will also have to be an integer,
  for that c%g should be equal to 0.(c%g==0)

  Let's say x0 and y0 is a possible solution.
  Then, ax0 + by0 = c (True)

  Genereal Solution{x,y} = {x0+(b*t)/g , y0-(a*t)/g}

  Substituting value of x and y in ax+by=c :- 

  = a(x0+(b*t)/g) + b(y0-(a*t)/g)
  = ax0 + by0

 Now as ax0 + by0 = c
	
 - We can keep any value of t in the equation, And that's why this has Infinitely Many Solutions.
